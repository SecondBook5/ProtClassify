    "# Automated Feature Selection Engine for Protein Classification\n",

    "## Step 2: Generation of Peptide Descriptors (`peptides.py`)\n",

    "In this step, an extended set of **physicochemical and QSAR-inspired descriptors** was generated for each protein sequence using the `peptides.py` library. The `Peptide.descriptors()` method was employed to compute a **102-dimensional feature vector** that numerically summarizes key chemical and structural characteristics of each input sequence.\n",

    "The descriptors span the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amino Acid Factor Scores**  \n",
    "  - VHSE: Principal components derived from hydrophobic, electronic, and steric properties  \n",

This convention facilitates descriptor group filtering, block-wise feature selection, and structured interpretability analyses.\n",

    "These descriptors provide **global, alignment-independent representations** of peptide sequences and are particularly valuable for capturing overarching chemical signatures. When integrated with localized sequence patterns and structural features (e.g., those computed in Step 3), this hybrid representation enables **robust, interpretable classification models** that generalize across protein families and functional classes."
